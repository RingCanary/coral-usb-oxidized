# Milestone: Holdout Family 8976/2352 Neutral-Core Patch (2026-03-01)

## Result
A **31-byte holdout patchset** was synthesized from endpoint dimensions `896` and `2688` for unseen target `1792`, and validated on Pi5 + Coral USB.

Patch composition:
- **PC:** 29 bytes (`res42 + res2`)
- **EO:** 2 bytes (`offsets 6723, 6726`)

Patch artifact:
- `traces/analysis/specv3-tiered-holdout-family8976-20260301T170035Z/milestone_candidate_baseline_equiv.patchspec`

## Hardware Validation
- Baseline output hash: `0x67709fedfd103a2d`
- Milestone patch output hash: `0x67709fedfd103a2d`
- Reboot-isolated repeatability: **5/5 passes** with identical hash

Validation runs:
- Matrix run: `traces/analysis/specv3-milestone-candidate-matrix-20260301T173234Z/`
- Repeat run (5x): `traces/analysis/specv3-milestone31-repeat5-20260301T173514Z/`

## What this proves
1. Word-field stride/formula analysis is decoding real instruction structure.
2. Tiered strict synthesis is correctly filtering DUT-toxic fields.
3. Holdout prediction is practically viable on hardware for a non-trivial neutral core.

## Strategic meaning
This 31-byte neutral core is now the trusted anchor for expansion:
- keep strict reboot-first gates,
- add one field-family at a time,
- preserve both transport stability and baseline-hash semantics.
